Thank you!
The list of environments you see in jupyter notebook is actually the kernel and not your virtual environment. You can use the default ""Python 3 (ipykernel)"" from any virtual environment to run your code. 

But in case you want to create a kernel by the name of your virtual environment then you can do that as well using the below command. You can run it in terminal from the desired virtual environment.

UgyqUolEzxxHK5QMgAJ4AaABAg,"I have Fossil Gen 5 and Galaxy active 2 and my wife has Versa 2. I can not say active  2 is better than fossil gen 5 or fitbit versa 2 because every product has its pros and cons. Yes the screen of Samsung is better because that's what they do. I mean Samsung is an expert in making high quality screens but even though, the screen of gen 5 and versa 2 is not that bad. I can use google pay and fitbit pay in these watches, but Samsung pay is not available in Germany for wearables, so most of the time I have Fossil on my wrist. the silicone band of Gen 5 and fitbit versa 2 are also very comfortable and you can sleep with your watch. I can talk about pros and cons of these three watches for hours because I am using them for a couple of months BUT I can not say samsung is better than the other two! Another thing which I don't like about Galaxy Active 2 Aluminum is its vulnerability. You have to be very carefull when you wear this watch because it scratches very easily especially around the corner and touch bezel.",1 year ago,Ali Eftekhar,UCepbIBSHCyUh5qARQiyHv9w,5,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTOH8MywOyKB_is1AwGNlyhR9CAMZuBQxsgLZRQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,1.0

But I feel versa 2 cannot be compared with active 2. versa 2 screen and UI is inferior compared to samsung.
And as you said, we can talk about pros and cons of each product for hours together however, I am sure there are a group of people who prefer samsung active 2 over fossil gen 5 and vice versa. And most probably its about what is important for that specific person. For me the display of samsung was way better than any other watches (excluding apple watch) and that was a primary reason for liking it.

UgxDDGeG-emxjaHA85J4AaABAg,"(at 5 minutes in) I actually work with SQL in a warehouse, and I would stop here and say the question and scenario is flawed. The warehouse management system should be redesigned first as it will have major issues in real warehousing scenarios.

The assumption that a warehouse that is designed to use FIFO will actually always do so assumes that no mistakes ever happen, no inventory ever gets misplaced, and nothing is ever manually moved outside the system design specifications. Among other things, a warehouse management system should know the current location, receipt date (or expiration date), and quantity for each pallet/location individually.

When you're already storing this information, the original question becomes trivial.

Also, the question does not account for inventory over a year old. Rare though it may be, it might still happen.

Find the total quantity of all the outbound stock.
    This can be found using a windowing/analytic function rather than a separate query.

For the inbound stock group into a number of buckets 90 days wide. 
    This avoids having to repeat code.
    The bucket number is simply the latest event date minus the event date all divided by 90.
        The latest event date can be found using a windowing/analytic function rather than a separate query.

Now, starting from the last bucket, subtract the total outbound stock until it has all been accounted for.

At this stage the results are in a column where they can easily be pivoted into the required row.

UgwaxCCvdVXEpKkBG8Z4AaABAg,"One Comment I have about your Query for the sake of consistency and loading time.

Replace your initial  *  with the deliberate list of the columns.

Explanation: This is because of Expansion, Redundancy and Query Optimisation, 

Expansion: Sometimes a 4 column datawarehouse may become 15 - 40 columns wide.

Redundancy: When you execute with * you get all the columns, even if you actually don't use them, and as the datawarehouse ages the query will be pulling redundant data increasing I/O for that query (Wear on the Hardware)

Query Optimisation:  The server engine will scope CPU for the full table in the first instance before your filtering, so to improve performance, moving forward always deliberately select what you need not everything from the table. This will also Index much faster because Deliberate Scope within the Statistics is easier for a CPU to handle as  the CPU does not have to check the columns it needs to pul because they are all declared.

I would think that in real world practice the query they would probably want would be from the current date rather than what they asked for. Your answer was correct for what they asked for.

Ugwr02Rf9HwsmzqQCK94AaABAg.9WanPsOgNiI9WumL_dr137,"To add a little bit, there is a function called ISNULL(). This function takes two values. The function evaluates the first value. If the first value is NULL, it will return the second value, regardless of its value. 

So, ISNULL(NULL,'Hello') returns Hello. 

Coalesce uses this same exact logic but allows you to include multiple values, always in left to right order.

So, COALESCE(NULL,'HI','BYE') returns Hi. It never gets to evaluate BYE, as it falls to the right of a valid return value. If all of the COALESCE values are NULL, it will return NULL. 

Just to add flexibility, 6ou can use a CASE statement to do the same thing as ISNULL OR COALESCE. 

For ISNULL:
CASE
       WHEN MyValue is NULL THEN  MySecondValue
       ELSE MyValue 
END 

For COALESCE:
CASE
       WHEN MyValue is NULL THEN CASE

An issue I would point out in your solution is that Day 1 is not the first entry but the current time (In an actual interview, someone would mention this and you can easily change it).  The warehouse could have not done anything for 4 months and your logic would be incorrect.

Ugy0N6A4IbRFecvedP94AaABAg,"First, this is a very good explanation so I don't want to detract from that.  However, in watching, I had to say that you jumped through a lot of hoops in the effort to keep this the way it is.  As some previous commenters pointed out, you could use various partition and window functions within the query to make things a bit easier.  Personally, I tend to avoid that approach.  I don't tend to care too much for nuanced and very complex queries that could get run on large tables - especially if there might be multiple people working with the report or code eventually.  The one thing I've learned is that the phrase ""competent with SQL"" is a very, very inclusive grouping.

Ideally, I would incorporate the bulk of my logic into a function.  Using something like pl/sql or pl/pgsql would allow you the internal freedom to have flow control and other elements.  But, more to the point, if you have a defined table structure, you can create a generic function to return in integer representing ending inventory for an arbitrary period.  Say it was named ""ending_inventory"" and took two integers for starting days from today and ending days from today as an argument.  Then your final query would be as simple as """"SELECT ending_inventory(0, 90) as '0-90 days',¬†ending_inventory(91, 180) as 91-180 days', ... etc.

This could easily be continued as far back as you wanted or could easily be wrapped into a programmatic loop to be built dynamically by a reporting engine.  As a function, it also allows the underlying code to be maintained without much disturbance of the front end and can be tuned much easier or, in the event of performance issues, promoted to a different language or function type.  I personally like to think down the road when this report has been around the block for five years, the original author is long gone, the table has grown to millions of entries, and something weird breaks.

Was it mentioned in the question that you need to find the age of inventory as of current day ?

If they specified explicitly that we needed to find the age as per current day then yes, using the current date from database would make sense but in this question they just asked for the age as per the given data ..

I fact the last shipment is on May 2020 and if I assumed current day as Day 1 then the output would be not as expected by this question..

As per their given output they kind of wanted us to treat last event date time as the Day 1 from when we needed to calculate the age..

That sample output was valid for some amount of days but isn't valid today if you run the script today. Unless specifically stated, sample outputs are not your goal.

Ugwnqlmx1Sl79uAYsRR4AaABAg.9W4QETbIG1q9WEPioEiqQV,"‚Äã¬†@Leighton¬† First of all, I think you're way overthinking things. What you're harping on is as simple as replacing d.day90 with today's date and time function. I would hope that the question is trying to see and understand your logic in solving the problem and the query that you use to do so rather than a very simple gotcha in the form of ""uh oh the data was from last year though so by you using the sample data as a reference for the expected output you've failed"". 

Also honestly, It's assumptive either way. Maybe the report was needed to see how long inventory stayed in the warehouse back in May 2020? Maybe the next step is a comparison from then to now to see how efficient they've been with only ordering what they need each inbound shipment. The question isn't clear and it's actually incorrect for you to assume the report needs to be current info as well. If this was a job you'd ask who needed the data what the intended use was. In an interview you'd ask the interviewer and at that point it's up to them as to what the report is trying to accomplish.

UgyGPW6x5muld9kGTaN4AaABAg.9ULP5MUdUQS9UOD-Y7lR6v,"SQL can be used to extract data, analyze data and load data to any other source.
Whereas, Excel is primarily used to view and analyze data (ofcourse you can do other things as well like visualization but there are better tools for visualization).

Loading large dataset in excel will make it very slow (almost unusable) whereas SQL can easily handle huge amounts of data.

Excel can be great tool when you want to share small data with your team members but if you need to share large dataset with team member then better share SQL queries.

There are so many more differences btw these 2 which I may not be able to explain in this comment here but in general both have their own use case..",5 months ago,techTFQ,UCnz-ZXXER4jOvuED5trXfEA,3,https://yt3.ggpht.com/68QpkOCRQespfOQ5yZwhCrM6Ab0kipqOU16JwAAhDm9f8I0CfPzMW-qpzdYJmn0TQ-UBd862=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

Ugw2xOpa0AHMIa3sEFF4AaABAg.9QI6U3zFjI29QRkBOjnZz9,"Hi, i think this happens in many companies.. More people are familiar and comfortable with Excel rather than SQL. 
And not everyone realizes the advantages of using SQL. 

Having said that, SQL is very useful for data analysis, extracting and loading data but when it comes to presenting your report to other colleagues or business users (who may or may not have access to SQL or who may just not be comfortable in SQL), it's better you provide them both the options of using Excel as well as SQL (share SQL query and also the steps to regenerate it)

Also may be add a single line at the end of your email stating the advantages of SQL.
I believe if you do this over a period of time, people will gradually start noticing SQL and perhaps start using it over Excel.

But I also believe that both SQL and Excel are here to stay so both will be used. Just that for some scenarios, it's better to use SQL and in some scenarios using Excel would be more efficient.",8 months ago (edited),techTFQ,UCnz-ZXXER4jOvuED5trXfEA,1,https://yt3.ggpht.com/68QpkOCRQespfOQ5yZwhCrM6Ab0kipqOU16JwAAhDm9f8I0CfPzMW-qpzdYJmn0TQ-UBd862=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

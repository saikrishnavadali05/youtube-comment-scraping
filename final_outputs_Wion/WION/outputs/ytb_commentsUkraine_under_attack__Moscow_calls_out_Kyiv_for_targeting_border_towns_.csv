Hi is there any Ukraine people and US Supporters out there?
***************‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
*Didn't the Ukrainian people drive this self-righteous clown away? Putin is the one who started the war. Although we blame war, Russia has its own position and reasons, because Russia is under military threat from NATO, but it is Zelensky the clown who destroys Ukraine. He doesn't understand economics or politics. This guy knows nothing and has a big mouth. He made war happen when it could have been avoided. Instead of trying to negotiate to stop the war in the early days of Russia's military campaign, he displayed an attitude that seemed to treat negotiation as children's play. He is like a naive clown who thinks he can get the support of the US and NATO. He can defeat Russia himself, he dreams that he can become a great man who fights Russia! He foolishly obeyed and cooperated with the instructions of the US side, instead of seeking peace talks, he turned Ukraine into his own stage and let the war deteriorate step by step. To this day, the clown is still working with the United States, continuing to expand the war indefinitely, and he still feels good about himself. Hold your own world tour hero speech and beg the world for weapons to keep fighting! Clowns play great men recklessly on stage, while thousands of Ukrainians cry for their loved ones who died in battle! The Ukrainian people should not put all the blame on Russia, they have to look at the whole situation from a different angle! Safeguarding the sovereignty of one's own country is the responsibility of a country's president, but the greatest responsibility of a country's leader is to avoid plunging the country into war, and what makes people angry is that his constant play of individualism has caused the war in Ukraine to continue unabated. ! This clown actually recruited militiamen in the name of defending the country, taught the people to make oil bombs, and encouraged them to fight despite the disparity in strength. He sold Ukraine to the United States, hoping the United States will help him clean up! Allow me to introduce the United States: a shameless country that keeps spreading rumors and provoking war, America = shameless low-end creatures, like vile creatures living in a ditch, thieves headed by a group of ugly creatures, they have no shame with false human rights and  Democracy is used as an excuse to sanction and occupy the sovereign assets of other countries. A low-end country that has truly committed countless genocides and human rights oppression, a country that is arrogant but behaves extremely low-end.

In Bucha, the Ny Times was close to the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion, whose soldiers appear in the newspaper‚Äôs photographs. In his piece, McCann suggests that Azov may responsible for the killings:
‚ÄúSomething very interesting then happens on [Saturday] 2 April, hours before a massacre is brought to the attention of the national and international media. The US and EU-funded Gorshenin Institute online [Ukrainian language] site Left Bank announced that:
‚ÄòSpecial forces have begun a clearing operation in the city of Bucha in the Kyiv region, which has been liberated by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The city is being cleared from saboteurs and accomplices of Russian forces.‚Äô
The Russian military has by now completely left the city, so this sounds for all the world like reprisals. The state authorities would be going through the city searching for ‚Äòsaboteurs‚Äô and ‚Äòaccomplices of Russian forces.‚Äô Only the day before [Friday], Ekaterina Ukraintsiva, representing the town council authority, appeared on an information video on the Bucha Live Telegram page wearing military fatigues and seated in front of a Ukrainian flag to announce ‚Äòthe cleansing of the city.‚Äô She informed residents that the arrival of the Azov battalion did not mean that liberation was complete (but it was, the Russians had fully withdrawn), and that a ‚Äòcomplete sweep‚Äô had to be performed.‚Äù Ukraintsiva was speaking a day after the mayor had said the town was cleaned out.

Of course if he doesn't succeed with his bid he could always sell his shares in Twitter at a nice profit and just start up his own Company as a rival to Twitter.

This is fact, and can be checked. There really is not need for argument here. However, this is a pride issue with the board members, especially with the Saudi prince.

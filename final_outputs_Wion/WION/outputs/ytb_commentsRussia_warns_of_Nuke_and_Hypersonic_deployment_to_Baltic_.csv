UgxKMv_oeAiwbqcH3494AaABAg,"Tell Iraqis, Afghans, Syrians and Libyans about how NATO is a ""DEfEnSivE aLlIaNcE"". It would appear as though the West is doing everything it can to escalate the situation - everything short of direct confrontation. One reason the invasion surprised so many of us was that we all underestimated how threatened Russia felt about NATO expansion eastward. Whether or not NATO actually pose a threat is a completely different story but it is also completely irrelevant. What matters is that they do believe NATO is an existential threat -- and if someone feels like their very existence is at stake, they will lash out - because the only other alternative is to ""die"" without putting up a fight. This is why the threat of crippling sanctions did not deter Russia. 

Sweden and Finland will NOT join NATO anytime soon. Blinken said it, without actually saying it when he said membership will depend on the agreement of other NATO countries at 0:32. Russia has very clearly demonstrated they are willing to risk it all for their survival and I am willing to bet that at least a few NATO countries will have second thoughts about allowing Ukraine, Sweden or Finland to join. What's the point of a defensive alliance if letting some nations join will drag you into a war? At least, I hope they are smart enough to deny them membership.

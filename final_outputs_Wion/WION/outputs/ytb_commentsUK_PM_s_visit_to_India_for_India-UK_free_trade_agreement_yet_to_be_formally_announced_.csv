It will be our identity that distinguishes us on this globe. We shouldn’t take it as a baggage. Caste is a dying issue. Legally there is no caste system in this nation. Caste discrimination is also punishable by law. Ofc discrimination exists but as the newer generation keeps rising the caste discrimination is also slowly wearing away over the years and it’s happening faster in the urban than in the rural areas. All we must do is not rekindle the caste system and resurrect it.

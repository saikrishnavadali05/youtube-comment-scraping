Ugw5UIhXfcxQujJZ05Z4AaABAg,"Divestment into Green hydrogen road transport will not eliminate use of the combustion engine.

Why are main garages on main arteries of every city, town, village not providing a service that converts petrol and diesel engines to green hydrogen engines?

This necessary inclusion for ridding future generations of the poisonous troubles present fuelling economies cause is a vital piece to global fuelling divestment.

I have personally contacted all main garage services and not one provides this conversion service. To improve the good health of nations throughout the world it is very important that we reduce our dependency upon fossil fuels. Conversion garage services in already established garage services is key to the improvement of road system safety. Road system safety is very much about the improved good health of city, town, village, inhabitants.

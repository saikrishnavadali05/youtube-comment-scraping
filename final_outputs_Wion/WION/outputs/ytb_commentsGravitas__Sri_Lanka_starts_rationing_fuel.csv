UgxQlZ-aCCRNht2KV7N4AaABAg,"FROM THE TIME OF ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM BRITISH RULE, THROUGH ITS NEGLIGENCE,  INDIA WAS INADVERTENTLY BEHIND THE LANKAN CRISIS WHICH TOOK PLACE ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN CEYLON.

BECAUSE OF ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY WITH INDIA, THE INDIAN SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS HAD A MORAL AND DIPLOMATIC OBLIGATION TO INTERVENE IN LANKAN AFFAIRS AND ANNEX IT WITH INDIA AS A STATE, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AT LEAST FOR THE SAKE OF ITS OWN NATIONAL SECURITY. 

BUT, BECAUSE OF THEIR SELFISHNESS AND FOOLISHNESS THE INDIAN POLITICIANS REFUSED TO DO SO.

LOANS TO LANKA IS NOTHING MORE THAN DONATIONS, BECAUSE, IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY, THE CASH STRAPPED LANKAN GOVERNMENT WILL EVER BE ABLE TO REPAY THE LOANS BACK TO THE CREDITORS. 

TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, THE LANKAN GOVERNMENT IS IN A PRETTY SIMILAR SITUATION AS INDIA, WHEN THE BRITISH EAST INDIA COMPANY OFFICIALS LENT MONEY TO THE CASH STRAPPED INDIAN MONARCHS, WHO WERE UNABLE TO REPAY THE LOANS. 

AT PRESENT, THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT IS STRUGGLING TO BRING DOWN THE RISING FUEL PRICES AND GENERAL COST OF LIVING, HENCE, NOT IN A HEALTHY FINANCIAL POSITION TO CONTINUE DOLING OUT LOANS TO THE LANKAN GOVERNMENT. 

BESIDES, WHAT MEANINGFUL RETURN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT GET FROM LANKAN GOVERNMENT FOR ALL THE FINANCIAL HELP IT IS OFFERING.

 INDIAN FISHERMEN CURRENTLY LANGUISHING IN LANKAN JAILS CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION QUITE ELABORATELY. 

WITH A CLEAR VISION FOR THE FUTURE, THE CHINESE ARE HELPING THE LANKAN GOVERNMENT ONLY TO TO GET THEIR FOOTHOLD IN LANKA. 

AS A FIRST STEP, THEY MANAGED TO BRING HAMBANTOTA PORT UNDER THEIR SWAY. 

UNLIKE THE INDIAN POLITICIANS, THE CHINESE POLITICIANS ARE QUITE SHREWD AND THEY WILL. IN NO DOUBT LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER ACQUISITIONS IN LANKAN SOIL, WHICH CAN BENEFIT THEM IN A LONG RUN. 

IN SHORT, SLOWLY BUT SURELY, THEY WILL SURPASS INDIA IN ESTABLISHING THEIR AUTHORITY IN LANKA. 

IF THE INDIAN POLITICIANS REALLY WANT TO HELP LANKA WITH ITS CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS, LET THEM ANNEX IT WITH INDIA WITH OUT DELAY, BEFORE IT FALLS FURTHER INTO THE RISING CHINESE DEBT TRAP. 

THIS CAN, IN NO DOUBT PUT AN END TO THE INCREASING CHINESE PRESENCE IN ITS SOUTHERN BORDER. 

BUT, WILL THE INDIAN POLITICIANS HAVE A VISION FOR THE FUTURE. IT IS IN EVERYONE'S GUESS. PERIOD.

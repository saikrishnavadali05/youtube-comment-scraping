UgxN2ml_dyia56rPiYB4AaABAg,"Among the many noises and dramas, the core point should not get lost.

- India will bail out colombo 
In return , India will  secure its  political, economical and geopolitical interest's. 
May not get involved in local tamil , sinhala politics.

- Federal or an out right Eelam, our aim is to recover from the negative impact caused by genocide,  to create a  secular  , happy, prosperous and a responsible society . 
Not to wage a war with sinhalese or for that matter with anyone.

-Rule of law is supreme, not Sharia law. 
muslims never asked the Sinhalese to implement their sharia law in the areas they are majority 

- out right Eelam??
India's position could change at the last minute in support of Eelam depending on many things. 
Secret agreements have already been signed between delhi and Colombo.  To sone extent, Indias concerns should be considered.  Ie, Russia invaded Ukraine to put an stop to the NATO expansion.

- The danger of Army taking over is a real possibilities., The question is when, after or before the bail out, 
after or before the pakshas go to jail for all sorts including the crimes committed during the war.

- India and china are not really enemies. In the case of Srilanka, they will work together to keep the US and the west away.

- We must have the power to formulate our own fiscal and monetary policies. 
Sinhalese cannot be trusted, and top of it, its ridiculous to ask the Tamils to pay for the war debt.

- Srilanka s external debt is $$$ 51 billion, Internal debt could be higher . Amounting to more than 100 billion$$$. 
Srilanka will be a slave country for an other 100 -200 years , we don't want to be part of it. In the internal debt , money could be owed to Rajapakse enterprise, Ranil & Co Ltd and to  the Maha sanga Mahathayas Plc.

- we must have an exit point , if and when the Sinhalese wants to wage a war with india. We dont want to take part in it  Since sinhalese may not pay back the money owed to India.

- If india retake katchatheevu, we must demand an out right independent Eelam without any reservations. Its a sign, India dont trust Colombo any longer , India may not reject the Idea of independent Eelam.

- If the US support us to form an independent Eelam, it should go to a referendum.
Out right Eelam or a federal set up in the NE  is the result of sinhalese""s  fault. 
Not India""s,  
even thou india has been an adversary all along . We must understand this point clearly.
At the same time , We dont want to fight a war with india, if a war breaks out between the US and India.

-Sinhalese need to accept that they fought a wrong war and died for the wrong reasons.  Karma.

- If the Sinhala political parties arent supportive of a meaningful political solution, we must make an appeal to the  IMF  against a bail out package for Srilanka at the earliest. Need to be tested before the money flow.

UgyrwQXq1yJdHD_DFCp4AaABAg,"Developing Sri Lanka is not a big issue if proper professionals with knowledge, skills, industry experience, potential and proven track records are appointed. The political mafia with frauds and foolish politicians mismanagement has driven sri lanka to this situation. Sri Lankan living abroad has taken their decisions not to transfer their foreign earnings to sri lanka until Gota Go Home and good governance is established. But President is only worried about securing their frauds allegations and not ready to step down no matter what happens to the country! So the current situation is worse and future is going to be terrible!                                                                                                  Sri Lanka has enough resources within the country, huge potential of exports and services, skilled and educated work force, no shortage of experts and etc. There are huge potential of exports revenue through IT sector as we have best IT professionals, well educated work force to earn foreign remittance, great potential of skilled apparel industry work force to earn export income from apparels, great potential of earning from sea ports as sri lanka locates at worlds best shipping routes, Sri lanka sea is under utilized for harnessing fishing, center in asia for airport services as well, sri lanka sea has huge reserves of unexploited gas and crude oil, world best quality graphite, abundant of minerals such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, quartz and etc, we have tropical climate through out the year with most suited rainfalls for cultivations including tea, rubber, coconut, spices, cashew and etc, we have world best gem stone mines, sri lanka is the best country for tourism in the world with highest bio diversity, etc. There are so many other earning potentials and each sector has the potential of multi billion revenues.                                                                               Unfortunately politicians have no knowledge to harness the potential of this country! This is the main issue.

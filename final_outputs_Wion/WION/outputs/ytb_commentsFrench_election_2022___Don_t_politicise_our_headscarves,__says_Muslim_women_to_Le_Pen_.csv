UgxR9E2WZKVh3vK_S494AaABAg,"To the ppl who say ""Burkha/Hijab is just a piece of clothing"". No, Burkha/Hijab isn't a piece of clothing. It's a religious symbol for others and if someone is wearing it, we get that they are muslim. If it was just a piece of clothing, you wouldn't be makin this big fuss now ryt?
To the people who say ""Hands off my hijab, woman's choice, don't try to police my clothes."" This is a piece of clothing that is already mandatory for you in the islamic religion. Why are you talking about women's choice when it's never been your choice to make in the first place? 
To the people who say it's islamaphobic to ban hijab....In places such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, all people (including non muslim immigrants) should wear burkha, it's mandatory. In places like qatar and saudi, other religions are not allowed to build their churches/temples or worship in public. Is that considered phobia towards every other religions? 
Hijab has been problematic from day 1. It is a mandatory piece of clothing and is a symbol of suppression for many women in countries like afghanistan. When in some parts of the world it's a symbol of suppression, it's hard for others to see it in a pretty light. 
People are treating symptoms. The need for wearing hijab is coming from ""needing to hide every bit of your body from male gaze"". Why? Can't your islamic males keep it in thier pants? Don't they have a clause in Quran telling them to keep it in their pants? One could also say that islam is making women to be ashamed of thier own bodies, treat themselves like sexual objects. 
People should follow rules of the country they reside in, be it muslims, christians or others. Yeah one could say that there is a slight islamophobia in all of this, But can you really blame anyone?

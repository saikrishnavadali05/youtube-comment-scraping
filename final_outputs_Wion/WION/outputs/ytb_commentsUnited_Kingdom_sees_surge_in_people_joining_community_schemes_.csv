Ugz_G8N5cn4e9o-X4Td4AaABAg,"I rent a government provided one bedroom flat from Dundee City Council in Scotland. It is a four in a block flat. I am not permitted to install solar panels or a wind turbine on the property because of government rules and regulations. This is one reflection of how electricity supply is monopolised by government departments.

I payed 35p overnight charges. As of April 1st this charge increased to a 60p overnight charge. An increase of 25p per night. The hourly rate has also increased from 30p to nearer 54p.

If my calculations are correct (there are roughly 70,000 households in Dundee City) and this price increase took place across the entirety of the city, the electricity provider SSE have increased their profits by ¬£17,500 per night. That is a staggering ¬£6,387,500 per annum of an increase.

Why do SSE suddenly need an extra ¬£6,387,500 per annum?

¬£91 is a substantial amount more for a single resident to pay per annum for electricity charges.

¬£91 per annum for not using electricity? It is a mini scandal enacted via government provision for the poor and destitute.

Even working from home, I found that in a week, the per unit cost of the electricity use only just passes the equivalent of the standing charge of a single day.

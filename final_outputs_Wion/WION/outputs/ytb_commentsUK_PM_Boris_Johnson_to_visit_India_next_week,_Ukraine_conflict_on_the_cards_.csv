UgzFP3J0fkMuB0bxn-14AaABAg.9_qHw0_xRlv9_qMbp6jaLa," @Jerry Naga  Slavery was common then many nations were active in the slave trade sadly.
The 100 years or so the empire was in the game. Millions of Europeans were snatched and sold on the slave markets also. 
I wonder have you heard of The West Africa Squadron. Don't believe what you read on wiki. 
The Empire tried to end all slavery a noble cause. They spent billions to do so. 
Like I said. A small little island, cannot control most of the world without millions upon millions of folk being part of the empire.",1 day ago,Jed Daniels,UCpcIdlM6SNLylBaxiLKmjsg,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQGMiNcTNqkRiidKOqZDvJNYFmJyiABHoZ6mg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

Ugzufh8IbZ3uC922Uhl4AaABAg.9_qEJl9pkLD9_qxXPsatJM, @Red Bull  are you an indian? I said kashmir issue isn't past..it's present. Do you know what is the stand of UK on Kashmir? They literally helped in giving PoK to Pak. Nehru gave it to keep peace as a compromise...but what happened? Pakistan is still greedy. Don't UK still support Pakistan in Kashmir issue against india? They have passed resolution in their parliament regarding this. If he is speaking like Liz truss or Blinken again...I'm pretty sure this time india won't keep its usual silence like always. We did give Blinken an apt reply. A partnership on equal footing is whats needed ...not of disrespect,23 hours ago,k,UCkXDclg3bRkfC1ivhw5zBng,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/AVozrAFz0xCYSmlG5zryN17NRKODzweG6OoJLXmLjS1y8mwN-4ZYkec1aEQqR5tNkfnwV2NctQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

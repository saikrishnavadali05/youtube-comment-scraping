Ugz4WXqZGpZySwNRU-94AaABAg.9_qGdKiURUc9_qtJ57q9a7,"¬†@Ahmed Mukhtar¬† Let's do a deep dive then. Why do you think Pakistan's economy worsened to the point that the common man got so agitated about prices of basic commodities? This agitation is what led to building up of the no-confidence motion. It's the same as what is happening in Sri Lanka. Surprisingly enough, China is able to persuade countries to take its loans despite their harsh lending policies. Under Shehbaz Sharif, this will continue to worsen as he is pro-China. He will be able to remain popular in Pakistan for 1 year by currying the favor of the Chinese but in the long run, Pakistan's economy is going to be demolished as a result. There are only 2 possible outcomes after that: Either Pakistan becomes a puppet of China or another political crisis (like Sri Lanka). In both cases, India needs to be wary. The first shall lead to Pakistan taking a more critical stance against India. The 2nd shall lead to a refugee crisis. Both of these will lead to increased insurgency. The best case scenario for both India and Paksitan was always a PM candidate like Imran Khan. The situation is too delicate for a change in leadership.",1 day ago,Aditya Chawla,UCDcdsS-5gawrsYIBT-B_qCg,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLSxRkvxFVq7Q1n2sKhqd0u3xbHY4sKm5j7NyQhemOAaKXux7QpaQnztBwcwpte7=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

Both countries have high inflation. That doesn't mean pak is becoming another srilanka. The no-confidence motion is a democratic process and it can happen at anytime. there's no need to call it ""Crises"".

I am not calling the no-confidence motion a crisis. But Pakistan is burying itself in its own loans. The BRI project yields 0 income to Pak until completed and Chinese govt offers no charity. Every infra they help build comes with a cost. It's a pattern that Indian news outlets have been hollering about since god knows when. Sri Lanka still ended up falling for it.

But you can't say that Pak didn't have a chance to form a strong alliance with the US. 

Even if we ignore the past, I can relate to your situation. China is to Pakistan what Russia is to India. But India has been diversifying its military alliances. We bought the Rafale from France and we are working on indigenous aircraft like the AMCA. The only way to save herself for Pak is to do exactly that. Invest in indigenous systems and form diplomatic relations with other countries which specialize in defense productions. If Pak continues to deal with China then it must be done very very carefully. Unfortunately, leaders are rarely ever educated enough to plan for that long in the future (I don't mean to insult Pak specifically, every country is like that). Another very simple alternative: Restructure BRI projects so that the self-serving Chinese don't get away with destroying Pak's economy. Let good sense prevail- Insist on approving BRI projects only if it comes with lower than ever interest rates and easy deadlines.

Imran khan is not corrupt as his name didn't appear in pandora or panama papers. He also initiated the ""Sehat card"" which literally allows poor people to get free treatment.

UgwF0xRD1kJ9U76mLch4AaABAg.9_qBCLhlBhk9_tN_lWOTKq,"¬†@Ahmed Mukhtar¬† lol dude i can feel it ,,, this is gonna be a long paragraph

first , Imran khan was rooting for Taliban . he wanted Taliban to win in Afghanistan , now if Taliban is attacking you . you should ask why in the first place he was rooting for Taliban
second , I as an Indian too believe to an extent that he was not corrupt like your other leaders in Pakistan , but under his leadership Pakistan rank in most corrupt countries has increase from 117 (in 2017) to 140 ( in 2020) so this explains the state of Pakistan 
also if he was corrupt he could easily overshadow his name because he was pm at that time 
third , on currency devaluation , is it his fault or this is also oppositions fault that your currency devalued from 105 per usd (2017) to 180 usd today  

also you talked about peoples support ,  lol bro peoples support in Pakistan means nothing , your most popular leaders like Benazir Bhutto, zulfikar ali bhutto , nawaz sharif , etc got killed , deposed , or exiled by your army 

you talked about his policies towards poor , i don't want to talk about price of medicine, sugar and tomatoes, lol 
his policies means nothing to your army 
they (pak army ) need to have good relation with west , their funding's come from west , they have properties in west , their children lives in west , they cant sustain to go against west 
 lol even Imran's sons lives in west

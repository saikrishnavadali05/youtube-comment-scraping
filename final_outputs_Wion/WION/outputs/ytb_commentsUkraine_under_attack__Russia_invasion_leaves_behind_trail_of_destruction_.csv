Who are those so called ""separatists"" in Donetsk and Luhansk? According to Igor Girkin - the former military chief commander of these ""separatists"" - they are the regular russian armed forces in disguise, very similar to the ""little green men"" in Crimea. Igor Girkin said this on several occasions in interviews with the newspaper ""Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung"" (2017) and the weekly news magazine ""Der SPIEGEL"" (2018). He lost his job as their military chief commander several years ago. Since then he occasionally talks about his time in Donetsk and Luhansk with foreign media.

There is also a significant number of russian POWs and killed russian soldiers from the regular russian armed forces who have documents which prove that they have been deployed to the Donbass since 2014. This is further backed with medals and awards which they have for their service in the Donbass since 2014. So we have the statements of Igor Girkin - the former military chief commander of those ""separatists"" - and personal belongings of russian POWs and killed russian soldiers which further back what Igor Girkin told several foreign newspapers.

So what does it mean? It means that the regular russian armed forces occupy the Donbass since 2014. That the ukrainian military tries to push them back out of Ukraine is the bare minimum of what everybody would expect from a country which has sovereignty and dignity. These regular russian armed forces which pretend to be ""separatists"" use the civilian population of the Donbass as human shields and are therefore solely responsible for their suffering. At the same time Putin denies that it's his own armed forces which fight against Ukraine in the Donbass and has the audacity to accuse Ukraine of breaking the Minsk agreement.

Yeah sorry, this whole Minsk agreement is an entire farce in the first place when Russia pretends to be a mediator between Ukraine and so called ""separatists"" while at the same time these ""separatists"" are regular russian armed forces who pull of a pathetic mascerade.

Within the russian military there is even an official term for this kind of warfare: Maskirovka (маскировка). I would like to quote the opening sentence of the Wikipedia article about ""Maskirovka"":

""Russian military deception, sometimes known as maskirovka (Russian: маскировка, lit. 'disguise'), is a military doctrine developed from the start of the 20th century. The doctrine covers a broad range of measures for military deception, from camouflage to denial and deception""

Russia's covert warfare in the Donbass since 2014 - in which its soldiers mascerade as ""separatists"" and ""militias"" - is the perfect example of ""Maskirovka""",13 seconds ago,dayooo2306,UCYIJ0AABhFS-R1a5BvPZNDw,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT_GI5SVYXSTZmbnlYkmalMAuaI4D3OLV2-ZQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

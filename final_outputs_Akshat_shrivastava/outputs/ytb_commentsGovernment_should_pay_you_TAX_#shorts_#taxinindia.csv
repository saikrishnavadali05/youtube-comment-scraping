Ugwy0V0btnffAfgb86p4AaABAg,"Ideally Govt should provide benefits to tax payers like Income loss benefits, Death benefits, illness benefits, retirement benefits etc. This is not complicated as it may sound. A small percentage of the tax you pay should be used to take a Insurance on your behalf & also to create a kitty like the pf to provide the benefits. 
The Covid crisis is a classic example wherein many people overnight lost their incomes- both salaried & business class. Inspite of them having paid lakhs or crores as taxes previously, they didn't get any benefit when they were in crisis!

Norway is a resource rich country, its revenue from oil and gas exports alone is USD 11.5 billion per month and the counrty's population has a right on those resources in a way through the sovereign fund. Hence, it makes sense for the govt. to support its population, while they can clearly afford to do so.",2 hours ago,barbie majumdar,UC1Qpm6hljkcndjVI_jyM0-g,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLTN5VeAgXlv-sBqLQ-n2WaPU6L8kXLiuZjFEQ=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

I'm Huge fan of your, thank you so much for spreading so much knowledge. I'm usually hesitant to comment, but just wanted to mention about the job loss insurance which is there in Canada.

The government should also pay ""traffic tax"" as the infrastructure it plans never supports the number of new vehicle brands they allow to sell their vehicles in India. Rather due to huge traffic, we consumers end up burning far more fuel and total cost of ownership goes up. It also leads to long traffic jams, loss of productivity, road rage, accidents etc etc. So government should also pay ""poor infrastructure tax"".

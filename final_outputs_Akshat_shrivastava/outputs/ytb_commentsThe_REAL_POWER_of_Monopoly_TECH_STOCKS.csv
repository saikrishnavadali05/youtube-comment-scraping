UgxiUrdynIYrwwWWE754AaABAg,"Hey Akshat,
From my point of view, comparing a company's marketcap with GDP may not be the right one, but still I feel this is a worrisome sign. As you said in the video, Feds or Senate will not be able to break such companies rather than questioning or summoning them. Also, investing in the US stocks will provide us currency appreciation as well. We have seen INR falling against US for a large amount of time and its less likely that it would change. So, betting on US stocks not only gives us monopolies, but more returns (when calculated the returns on INR) and diversification as well. As mentioned regarding the monopolies traits, I completely adhere with you. Most of the top companies are thriving hard for Ecosystem play, Expansion and dominance. It would be better for us to learn if you could make some case studies on monopolies of different sectors.

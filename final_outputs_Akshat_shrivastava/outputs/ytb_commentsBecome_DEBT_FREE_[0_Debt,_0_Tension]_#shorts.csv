UgyrAsWmZGQFuF84JDx4AaABAg,"Hey Akshat, first things first. Great content that you provide. I love watching your videos. It helps me learn a thing or two each day about personal finances and  investments. Thanks a lot for that . 

However, I have a question about debt. I have read Robert Kiyosaki's ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" and have also been watching his talk shows. In his book and on one of the shows he talks about purchasing Real estate with 100% debt and 0 investment from his hand, contradictory to what you have said here. I may be mis-interpreting it, can you please advise / clarify?

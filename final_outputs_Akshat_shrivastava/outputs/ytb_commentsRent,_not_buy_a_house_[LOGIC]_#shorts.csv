UgzyiFT0nhrPzroyUcB4AaABAg,"Speaking from the middle class perspective, if you buy a house in a city, you're essentially tied to that location for the rest of your life. What if you want to move to another place with much better opportunities?

If you think of it as an investment, a basic house costs around 50 lakh and if you get your housing loan at a 'cheap' 6.55%, in the best case scenario you would be paying 32,000 a month as EMI to the Bank for 30 years to pay back the loan. So it takes you 30 long years to break even on your initial investment and convert your liability into an asset. This doesn't even include the additional investments like furnishing, renovation, painting, upkeep and maintenance required to make the house livable. Don't forget property tax either.

Better to pay 15,000 as rent to live in a good house near to your place of work and have the freedom to change houses whenever you want. Save up money and buy a better house in your small hometown at half the price and go back there when it's time to retire.",1 month ago,MegaRazzzz,UCz-rCaVLG2TevTmN_wGFNqg,88,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLT54obSLDTRol6DFnPKHjFwXjFhPCOgvrXkWlD2=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

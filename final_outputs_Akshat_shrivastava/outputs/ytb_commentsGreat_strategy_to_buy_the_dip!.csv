Ugyeiz354aUcI-lVtGp4AaABAg,". i suggested to add just before 8 days with the target of Rs120 and on the last day of 2021 a new target come but as per my research i already give the target. Buy Federal Bank: target of Rs 139: Sharekhan Sharekhan is bullish on Federal Bank has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 139 in its research report dated December 30, 2021

Federal bank ‚Äì 5 targets for next 30 days ie. Till 15th January due to that now every price is buying price before buy first make plan to add continue on every dip till next 10 days due to that on every dip also reduced the cost of buying and average come. 
Why I give 5 targets can read but first see the targets. 
Rs94 for a week, 100 for 15 days and 108 for 21 days and in the 4th week we will see it will made now life time high with closing above 120.
See book value is Rs83 and share traded at very attractive price my wait is now complete to add now below 89.50 From current price the risk reward come in the favour so buy start now.  I keep watch from its down from 98 and  now can add . 
Nippon India Arbitrage Fund Growth was the highest buyer of 2,800,000 shares in Nov 2021 constituting 0.13% of the paid up equity of the company.
In November month 35 mutual fund added this share in which major name is hdfc,Nippon , Ederwise, uti,tata, Mirae, sbi, tata and Aditya birla fund. Tata fund now hold 82,70000 share so Aditya birla now hold 58 lacks share, Nippon now hold 2 crore shares, hdfc now hold more than 5 crore shares, UTI hold 1.61 crore shares, Invesco fund fresh entry with the 3.10 lacks shares, kotak now hold 5.72 crore shares, icici pru aso hold 48 lacks shares and DSP mid cap hold 4.11 crore shares . 
See high of  November  was Rs 104 and low is Rs84 now see total 35 mutual fund added and can assume that all are buy on low side. The median of November  Rs 94 . see and can assume the buying price of all 35 mutual fund is between Rs 94 to 84 and the 84 come for a second so its justify that all are buying between 94 to 85 so its also very clear as per data all are buying on differ prices on differ day . See out of 18 trading days of November and 35 mutual fund added means every day near to 2 mutual fund add this share.  We also well knows the bank give wonderful results in the second quarter and third we will see better than first and second quarter. 
See some big investor advisers give the target of Rs115 and I give the target of RS120 plus they are give buy above 94 and I give buy today at the RS89.30 in the both cases my followers buy at low price means the returns also big in compare to all mutual funds when its touch 115 and 120. 
The correction is now over and tomorrow also a bank Nifty weekly closing so short covering also see . In the third quarter FIIs also added 1% and now increased from 24.1% to 25.9 % and this now come on year high.  See FIIs selling in the past few days only the share which are traded life time high and over price in compare to fundamentals. 
The gold business loan continue grow and due to festival session the third quarter the business of gold loan also increased. 
If any one want so first make a chart to add from the current price to upto 78 because no one 100% sure how much further go down so first plan and  than start in SIP upto 78 , see from today I will also added and my chart is complete now. I share to all first time due to which I never earned a loss in the market. 
From 79.50 with 100 shares and after down of 25 paise I will added further 100 shares and if price come down below 78 , I will triple the buying 300 shares for next 10 days on every dip of 50 paise. My call not for a intraday I give only positional call. Keep add for the returns 30 to 45% in next one months. 
The big recovery of pending loan of covid period now recovered and ratio on % wise recovery is 70 to 80% of past loan so this amount either used for reducing the further NPA or used for banking purpose. 
The Net profits is very clear to cross Rs500 cr plus and EPS we will see Rs2.80 to 3.20 for the third quarter and all aspect clearly indicate that all 35 mutual funds those who have big technical team add this share at higher price in compare to my call now .  So enjoy good profits in the coming days",3 months ago,thirdeye 2015,UC-R6dGvsAqiHR4MBFVG58Og,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLQks10JqUuSmfgoPylIQ2Fc4nzXVCh8OclZ7slj7y2bwEcc24UF6sxAtKbRPj2r=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0

UgySOSdErr_g2Cndd1t4AaABAg,"I would like to understand the fact clearly. When will the 1% TDS being deducted? When will the 30% Tax will be deducted?

I will explain my understanding so far. Correct me if I misunderstood/wrong at any point.

Firstly we will deposit our money (INR) from bank to crypto exchange wallet. During this money transfer, 1% TDS will deducted to monitor the each person crypto transaction/investment activity by govt. 

Then we will buy any crypto tokens in crypto exchange and hold it for certain period. After some period, we sell the holding crypto token and booking profit. Then we will receive our money in crypto wallet. I believe the money which is staying at crypto wallet won't be taxed until it will be moved to bank account. Am I correct?

(Or)

Will govt deduct the 30% tax on crypto gain from crypto exchange wallet itself? Is it possible? Does Indian crypto exchange agreed to this?

I hope the finance minister & Central dispensation let go their ego before announcing such schemes where public money is going to go to waste. Regarding RBI's digital currency, i too think it will be a failure. This government is actually to centralise everything to get control of people's money.

Ugx5sdv1mivtGD9kX6V4AaABAg,"What is this nonsense  30% tax on profit on every transaction? ü§î if we earn profit using our brain burning the midnight oil to watch all the ups and downs 24 hours we have to give 30 % to govt but if losses occur nobody  comes to rescue.  If we earn 10rs profit we give 3 rs to government   then next day if we get 10 rs loss we have to bearüò° 
Atleast in stock market we can be peaceful after 3:30 pm and weekends.  Here we risk our money and dedicate ourselves full time and share 30 % profit with the govt? Crypto is not purely luck  it is a new concept designed for the benefit of the mankind and free us from the clutches of unscrupulous govts worldwide.
Atleast in lottery tickets we buy and keep our fingers crossed and if we did win the prize  we give 30% to govt   is crypto equal to a lottery scheme?
How can capital gains apply to every transaction? Normally properties are not sold frequently like say everyday every fortnight every month every year  but crypto is bought and sold at the spur of the moment going by the global trends 
  This 30% tax per transaction will kill the will of the people who r believing crypto would bring some sunshine into their lives.   

This is totally unfair.Atleast they should apply this 30% every year end",2 months ago (edited),chandrakala gowrishetty,UC82k2FvjCbFDT7-sFsjusCw,0,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLR2-dh5bgBBeZzSDhId8QQMmsWPJnXTTC9TjA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0.0
